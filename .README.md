# How to develop
1. Run the devcontainer
2. Each new stow package (folder) must be mounted individually
3. Make sure the profile you are using for develpment are NOT using the `dotfiles` settings you are using when consuming this repos. If you find a folder named '~/dotfiles' in your devcontainer - you need to remove theses settings.
